I thank you for installing my first flatbed towtruck mod and i hope you enjoy it, lots of work was put into this. Enough of me yapping time to install.

I built this vehicle specifically for fivem which means i don't know the exact outcome with a singleplayer install.

The folder you downloaded includes everything you need for a drag and drop install into your fivem resource along with a
tow script which is named under "tow" in the folder.
First thing you'll do is drag both the dsflatbed and tow into your resource folder. After that you will go into your
server.cfg file and type "start dsflatbed" and "start tow" and that should be all you need to do.
